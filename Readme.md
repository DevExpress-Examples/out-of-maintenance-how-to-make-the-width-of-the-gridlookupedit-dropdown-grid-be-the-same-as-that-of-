# How to make the width of the GridLookUpEdit dropdown grid be the same as that of the editor


<p>The sample project demonstrates how to set the initial width of the popup grid to the same size as the GridLookUpEdit control. </p><p>Note that the end-user can resize the dropdown grid to another size he or she prefers. After that the dropdown grid retains the size set by the user.</p><p>This approach is also applicable to other popup editors: MemoExEdit, PictureEdit, and PopupContainerEdit. It also works when editors reside within a container, such as the XtraGrid, XtraTreeList, or XtraVerticalGrid.</p>
